## Models

### Model 0

Trained against where multiple tokens right before the laughter are marked as the positive case

Poor numbers, likely due to the construction process of the punchline labels

**Loss:** 0.2421
**AUC:** 0.5921

### Model 1

Trained against token right before the laughter is the positive case, everything else is false

Leads to it mainly predicting on puctuation as that marks the end of a sentence

**Loss:** 0.1128
**AUC:** 0.7572
