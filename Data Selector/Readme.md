# Data Selection

A small Jupyter based GUI to help select data from YouTube. It searches YouTube #Standup in a list. It is the users job to select the videos to use and the Transcript to use. It is important that the transcript and audio is in english and that there is an audience that is reacting to the audio. The [ETL pipeline](../ETL/) will use both the audio and the transcript to create a dataset to train and test on.
